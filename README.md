# Overview

In this project I really tried to implement all the elements of object-oriented programming. This is simple software where one could play the popular game of flappy bird.


We start out by building classes for the program. Each class has methods that are assigned to do a specific job. We encapsulate the data by using abstract keywords so 
that it cannot be manipulated or changed. The objects in the program inherit color and positioning. Then, I overide one of the objects to still be an object in the game, but it will serve a different purpose and shape in the game. 

The purpose of this program is not only to have an enjoyable game, but to also excercise and organize desgin around the data instead of methods and logic.

# Development Environment
Raylib was one the tools I used to make the game. It has a great website for information about building games. I also had to download .NET in order to run my C# sharp program..NET is a framerwork and runtime.

C# is a great language to practice object oriented programming. This language allows you to do a number of different programs and applications on mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud -based services and so on.
